# what-todo
This is the documentation around a project I'm using as a vehicle to learn new languages and framework.  I'd like to build basically the same app although it may take different forms based on the language.  The app will be a ToDo app, which is familiar and has a reasonable amount of complexity.  

### Project Requirements:
* Have a way to create new lists
* Have a way to view all lists
* Be able to display a single list
* Allow the user to rename a list
* Have the ability to delete an empty list
* Allow the user to create a task in a list
* Allow the user to alter the state of a task
* Allow the user to edit the content of a task
* Allow the user to delete tasks

### Languages/Frameworks
The following list are mediums I may or may not be considering (in no particular order):

* [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com) - this is what I'm most familiar with so I may start here as a baseline.
* [Python (without Django)](https://www.python.org/) - I'm pretty comfortable here, perhaps I'll build a ToDo that isn't web-based.
* [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) - this framework is pretty close to Django, but I've never used it to build anything before.
* [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
* [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/)
* [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/)
* [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
* [Java](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/index.html)
* [React-JS](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
* [C++](https://isocpp.org/get-started)
* [Go](https://go.dev/)
* [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/)
* [PHP](https://www.php.net/)
* [F#](https://fsharp.org/)
* [PureScript](https://www.purescript.org/)
