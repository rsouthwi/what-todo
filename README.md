# what-todo
This is the documentation around a project I'm using as a vehicle to learn new languages and framework.  I'd like to build basically the same app although it may take different forms based on the language.  The app will be a ToDo app, which is familiar and has a reasonable amount of complexity.  This app must:

* Have a way to create new lists
* Have a way to view all lists
* Be able to display a single list
* Allow the user to rename a list
* Have the ability to delete an empty list
* Allow the user to create a task in a list
* Allow the user to alter the state of a task
* Allow the user to edit the content of a task
* Allow the user to delete tasks

The languages/frameworks may or may not include one or more of the following (in no particular order):

* [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com)
* [Python (without Django)](https://www.python.org/)
* [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/)

* [Java](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/index.html)
* [React-JS](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
* [C++](https://isocpp.org/get-started)
* [Go](https://go.dev/)
* [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/)
